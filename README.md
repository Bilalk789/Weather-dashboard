# Weather-dashboard 
## Project 
In this project we were tasked with making a weather webpage to display current weather, and 5 day future forecast. Also were tasked to have three properties showing for each day, Humidity, windspeed, and temprature. 
## Design
The design aspect for my personal project inspires from a "weather app" look, I tried my best to get it to look similar with my knowledge up to now. other design aspects are using colors, flex properties, and the normal style properties. The API usuability was a hard one to figure it out and how to correctly place it in the code and get the correct API key, and then link it properly to just show the 5- day forecast.
## Closing 
The code will run smoothly, wihtout any issues. I have not encountered any issues at the moment.
